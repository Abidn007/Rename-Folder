# Rename Research Papers with PowerShell

When doing research on a specific topic, we often download a large number of scientific papers from platforms like **Google Scholar**, **PubMed**, or **Semantic Scholar**. To organize them properly, it's useful to arrange them into folders by year (e.g., `2025`, `2024`, `2023`, etc.).

However, manually renaming 20, 50, or even 100+ papers can be extremely time-consuming.

This script allows you to **automatically rename** PDF files in a folder using **Windows PowerShell**, assigning them sequential numbers like `1.pdf`, `2.pdf`, `3.pdf`, etc. This makes referencing, manuscript writing, and future retrieval much easier.

# RenameFolder.ps1

#
This PowerShell script helps researchers organize a large number of PDF research papers downloaded from sources like Google Scholar, PubMed, or Semantic Scholar. 
It automatically renames files in a numeric sequence (e.g., 1.pdf, 2.pdf, 3.pdf...) which is helpful for easy reference, reading, and manuscript writing.

Place this script inside the folder that contains the PDFs, or modify the $folderPath to point to your specific folder.
#>

# Define the folder path where the PDF files are located
$folderPath = "F:\4th Year Project\Project\Paper\Dry Lab\Pseudomonas aeruginosa\2023"

# Get all PDF files in the folder and sort them by name for consistent renaming order
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $folderPath -Filter "*.pdf" | Sort-Object Name

# Starting number for renaming the files
$startNumber = 1

# Loop through each file in the folder
foreach ($file in $files) {
    # Generate the new file name using the current number
    $newFileName = "$startNumber.pdf"

    # Construct the full path for the new file name
    $newFilePath = Join-Path -Path $folderPath -ChildPath $newFileName

    # Check if a file with the new name already exists in the folder to avoid overwriting
    if (-not (Test-Path $newFilePath)) {
        # Rename the current file to the new file name
        Rename-Item -Path $file.FullName -NewName $newFileName
        Write-Host "Renamed '$($file.Name)' to '$newFileName'"
    } else {
        # If the new file name already exists, skip renaming to avoid conflict
        Write-Host "File '$newFileName' already exists. Skipping '$($file.Name)'."
    }

    # Increment the number for the next file
    $startNumber++
}
